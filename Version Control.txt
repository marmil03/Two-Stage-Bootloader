Version control:
[16-bit real mode] - following versions of code for boot sector were made in early learning phase (learning assembly x86_64 and os concepts alike)

10.02.2021.  ver 0.001a - simple infinity loop, assigning magic number(0x55aa) and filling 510 of 512 bytes with zeros
10.02.2021.  ver 0.001b - added printing message character by character on screen using BIOS interrupt(0x10)
14.02.2021.  ver 0.001c - added specific seperate procedur for printing messages on screen using BIOS interrupt
14.02.2021.  ver 0.001d - updated main boot sector code to print messages using external procedure
18.02.2021.  ver 0.002a - added procedure for reading and printing hexadecimals, used for debugging purposes
18.02.2021.  ver 0.002b - updated main code in order to test new procedure, swapped old messages for relevant ones
18.02.2021.  ver 0.002c - updated print message procedure, added printing new line
18.02.2021.  ver 0.003a - added procedure for reading from disk drive
18.02.2021.  ver 0.003b - updated main code to reflect added procedure and added test code(for testing previouse procedure)

[32-bit protected mode] - after learning basic concepts of boot sector and assembly programming it is time to switch to protected mode
06.03.2021.  ver 0.01a  - Added files for switch to protected mode, GDT mode (todo: A20Line,fix printing in pm)
07.03.2021.  ver 0.01b  - fixed printing error
07.03.2021.  ver 0.01c  - altered print function in 32-bit mode so it doesn't overwrite previous message
11.03.2021.  ver 0.02a  - Added A20 line checking and activation! Updated main file and done minor fix in printing. Boot sector is 36 bytes to large, needs optimization.
11.03.2021.  ver 0.02b  - Optimized code to fit inside 512 byte limit
12.03.2021.  ver 0.03   - I made a decision to move to two stage bootloader system due to lack of space to do everything i wanted in first stage. 
			  Added OEM/BIOS description block,file system description, looking for a file (second stage) in root directory and loading second stage of bootloader. 
			  Second stage looks a lot like first main(boot_sector_main.asm from earlier versions) file of bootloader. 
			  Due to size of this update to bootloader some errors were expected, mainly, file of second stage is not found(suspected segment assigment error or possible file name reading error), 
			  after fixing these, intention is to enable paging, add IDT and finaly proceede to loading Kernel. 
13.03.2021.  ver 0.04   - Fixed file reading error(few lines of code were missing in read_file macro and wrong label was called, fixed file name(it was more than 11 bytes)), 
			  updated second_stage_main.asm and prepared for loading kernel.
			  Added comments to 90% of the code.
			  I decided to switch to GRUB for main OS project.
			  This marks the end of bootloader saga.(For now; i'll probably come back to it later).

[64-bit long mode] 	- for now, there is no intetion of switching to 64-bit mode, but i want to leave this option open if i decide to make 64-bit OS in the future and after i become better and understand more of OS concepts

Notes for future.
Missing things: Paging, IDT, finall kernel jump, Makefile(!)
I used FAT16 file system. Useful info can be found at this site: http://www.maverick-os.dk/FileSystemFormats/FAT16_FileSystem.html
